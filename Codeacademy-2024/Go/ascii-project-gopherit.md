# Learn Go: Gopher It - ASCII Art Project

Dive into Go programming by creating something fun and engaging! This project will utilize the `fmt` package to craft ASCII art. While we suggest making a gopher, feel free to unleash your creativity.

## Getting Started

### Basic Go Structure

1. **Package Declaration**: Begin with `package main` at the top of your `main.go` file.
2. **Import Packages**: Import necessary packages. For this project, `import "fmt"` is essential.
3. **Main Function**: Define the `main` function where your ASCII art code will reside.

### Printing ASCII Art

4. **Using `fmt`**: Explore `fmt`'s various functions to print your art. Documentation can be found directly in Go's package documentation, through the `go doc fmt` command, or via a search engine.
5. **Create Your Art**: Print your ASCII art to the terminal. Here's an example:

    ```
      __      _
    o'')}____//
     `_/      )
     (_(_/-(_/
    ```

6. **Save and Run**: Save your code, then either build and run the executable or use `go run main.go` to directly execute your program.

## Challenge Yourself

- Alter your ASCII art's design.
- Incorporate the current time using the `time` package.
- Experiment with different `fmt` and `time` package functions to enhance your program.

Enjoy crafting your ASCII art with Go and see where your creativity takes you!
