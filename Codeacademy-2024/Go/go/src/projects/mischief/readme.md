# Comic Mischief: Managing Your Comic Book Catalog with Go

## Project Overview

This project leverages Go programming to efficiently manage a comic book store's inventory. By utilizing variables and types, we can catalog various aspects of each comic book, such as the publisher, writer, artist, and more.

## Project Tasks

### Setting Up the Go Program

1. Declare the package with `package main`.
2. Import the `fmt` package to enable data output.
3. Create the `main` function as the entry point of the program.

### Defining Comic Book Variables

- Declare string variables for `publisher`, `writer`, `artist`, and `title`.
- Define integer variables for `year` and `pageNumber`.
- Create a `grade` variable with type `float32` to represent the condition.

### Variable Assignment for "Mr. GoToSleep"

- Assign "Mr. GoToSleep" to `title`.
- Store "Tracey Hatchet" in `writer`.
- Set `artist` to "Jewel Tampson".
- Assign "DizzyBooks Publishing Inc." to `publisher`.
- Use `1997` for `year`, `14` for `pageNumber`, and `6.5` for `grade`.

### Updating Variables for "Epic Vol. 1"

- Copy the print statement for "Mr. GoToSleep".
- Reassign `title` to "Epic Vol. 1".
- Update `writer` to "Ryan N. Shawn" and `artist` to "Phoebe Paperclips".
- Keep the same `publisher`.
- Change `year` to `2013`, `pageNumber` to `160`, and `grade` to `9.0`.

## Expanding the Catalog

Consider adding more variables for additional comic book details or creating new series with unique data.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the versatility of Go in handling data, offering a solid foundation for managing and expanding a comic book catalog.
