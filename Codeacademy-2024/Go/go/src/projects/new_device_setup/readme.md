# New Device Setup Project

## Overview
This project involves programming the setup process for a new smart device using Go, focusing on capturing and utilizing user inputs with the `fmt` package.

## Objectives
- Learn to declare variables and take user inputs in Go.
- Use the `fmt` package functions to print and format strings.
- Master the art of prompting user information and responding accordingly.

## Tasks

### Learning Your Name
1. **Declare a Name Variable**: Start by declaring a string variable to store the user's name.
2. **Prompt for Name**: Ask the user for their name using `fmt.Println()` and capture the input with `fmt.Scan()`.
3. **Greet the User**: Use the captured name to greet the user personally.

### Learning the Age
4. **Declare an Age Variable**: Set up an integer variable for the user's age.
5. **Prompt for Age**: Inquire the user's age with a print statement and store the response using `fmt.Scan()`.
6. **Summarize User Info**: Utilize `fmt.Printf()` to output the user's name and age in a descriptive message.

### Reformat the Message
7. **Create a New Message Variable**: Use `fmt.Sprintf()` to format the user's information in a new way.
8. **Craft an Alternate Message**: Include the user's name and age in a different format within `fmt.Sprintf()`.
9. **Display the New Message**: Print out the reformatted message about the user.

## Completion
By the end of this project, you'll be adept at handling user inputs, variable declarations, and string formatting in Go, laying a solid foundation for future Go-based projects.
